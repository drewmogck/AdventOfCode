# AdventOfCode_2020

### Code snippets from Advent of Code 2020. Using as an excuse to drag myself out of R where I am pretty comfortable and get some daily work in with Python.

### Notes:  
- Day 1: Not too bad  
- Day 2: Got frustrated with pandas, too used to the tidyverse - ended up doing some in excel due to time constraints and the simple frustration of knowing what I wanted to do but struggling to implement it in code.  
- Day 3: Back on track  
- Day 4: That was a doozy. Had to watch my regex. Been a while since I've used and spent a while debugging why I was off on the final count (by 1!)  
- Day 5: Went pretty smooth - sure my code could be cleaned up but pulled through this one in a decent time. *Note to self: remember to clear the new line character from text data when parsing...
